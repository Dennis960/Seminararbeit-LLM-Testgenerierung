## Question
Write a program that processes a list of students' names and their corresponding scores, to determine the highest scoring student(s). If there are multiple students with the highest score, return all their names in alphabetical order. Your task is to create a function that accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a student's name and their score.

Example input:
students_scores = [("Alice", 85), ("Bob", 90), ("Charlie", 88), ("Dave", 85), ("Eva", 90)]

Expected output:
["Bob", "Eva"]
